# Gruperia

______________
#### Gruperia is a plataform to spread groups for networking. You can:

  - Create a group
  - Found a group
  - Suggest a group

#### This groups can be:
  - Facebook
  - WhatsApp
  - Meetup
  - Whatever you want use to spread

So far I'm working on a CRUD with Firebase, and I need to implement the authentication functionality, so that each user needs to log in and can only modify / delete their own group.



### Comments

- Theres no depedencies to download
- The Firebase have my Config setup (with token, URLs, etc.). So you need to change that to see it working
-



### Todos

 - Auth users
 - CRUD groups
 - Add Comments to each group
 - Public or private groups

#### That's it for now.
